"descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This seminar is designed for the general campus student. Students with a music major, or a dual degree with music, are not permitted to register for this seminar. The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts - you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six to eight hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions. During and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus - during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life. After Week One's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice). Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CDs will learn a variety of conducting techniques - mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate interpretation, phrasing, dynamic shading. You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "In lieu of a textbook, we will be working with a digital platform called Music In the Air (\"MITA\").

The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven's music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century. This course aims to better understand Beethoven's music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven's vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven's expansion of music genres; exploring important performers of Beethoven's music; understanding connections between Beethoven's music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today in a global context.

Initially propelled by exponents of the Schenkerian theory, these advances were more recently fueled by representatives of the cognitive study of music, neo-Riemannian theory, and historical music theory, among others, and they brought about a rich inventory of analytical tools applicable to variety of musical repertoires.

The first of these is the broad realm of gender and sexuality studies known as trans or transgender studies, and the second is transformational theory, a major subfield of contemporary North American music theory since the 1990s. Theories of trans identity are highly contested, explicitly political, and culturally current. Transformational theory is largely formalist (albeit with a pronounced and seemingly paradoxical phenomenological substrate). In this seminar we will consider the ways in which these intellectually distinct areas of thought might speak to each other.<br/><br/> The most readily apparent common thread between the two involves a set of questions around what it means to move from one state to another?or, alternately, how the distance or space between states is to be understood. The distinction between these modalities is absolutely crucial to both areas of thought, and both theorize the distinction in explicit terms. David Lewin, who came to be understood as the founder of transformational theory, begins his seminal book \"Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations\" with a simple diagram of a unidirectional arrow. Colloquially known as \"Lewin's arrow,\" the meaning of the diagram has been widely glossed as \"the interval from s to t is i,\" where \"interval\" refers to \"directed measurement, distance, or motion\" between any two entities (not necessarily pitches) within a defined musical \"space\" (Rings 2011, 12; Lewin 1987, xxix). Note the distinction between \"distance\" and \"motion\"; these concepts subsequently form the two main theoretical foundations of Lewin's approach. <br/><br/> Almost thirty years later, in an essay on trans identity in the \"London Review of Books\", Jacqueline Rose counterposes the perspective offered by trans theorist Jay Prosser, for whom the \"move from A to B is a conclusive self-fashioning or it is nothing,\" with that of Kate Bornstein, for whom \"in her new life, as for [Susan] Stryker, transsexuality is an infinite confusion of tongues\" (vol. 38:9, May 2016). In trans theory, and more specifically in theories of \"transition,\" a unidirectional arrow can represent directed motion toward a stable alignment of body and identity whose realness is absolutely crucial, while for others the line has no arrow, is infinitely divisible, or is completely unsuitable as a model.<br/><br/> Major questions posed by this course include the following:<br/>? How can the diverse perspectives on transition articulated by trans theorists and activists productively destabilize certain widespread assumptions within music theory?<br/>? What can music theory, in which \"transition\" is a fundamental concept in contexts ranging from the undergraduate classroom to the most rarified intellectual circles, contribute to broader discourse on the subject?<br/><br/>Students in the course should have an advanced understanding of music theory as a professional discipline and fluency in musical analysis.

What happens when these systems collide?

federal, and state jurisdiction in Indian country according to default rules as well as special statutory regimes. Specific topics for study and analysis include the foundational doctrines of original Indian title; inherent tribal sovereignty; congressional plenary authority over American Indian affairs; and the federal trust duty to protect American Indian lands and rights. These doctrines' impact on the contemporary lives, resources, cultures, and rights of the American Indian peoples will be evaluated within selected legal frameworks. <br/><br/>Federal Indian law is of obvious relevance to those students with an interest in our indigenous nations and their populations. Less obvious, however, is the importance of rulings in the field for law more broadly defined. For example, Chief Justice John Marshall's opinions in the so-called Cherokee cases of the early 1800s were foundational in determining the obligation of states to abide by decisions of the Supreme Court. Further, understanding Federal Indian law is crucial for any lawyer who represents a tribe or advises investors whose capital is to be connected, even if only in a tenuous way, with a federally recognized tribe. <br/><br/>After covering the foundational material, this course examines in greater depth selected specialized areas such as: civil and criminal jurisdiction within Indian country; missing and murdered indigenous women; environmental law; taxation; cultural and religious freedoms; child welfare law; gaming; economic development; reserved water rights; food sovereignty; cultural sovereignty; and hunting and fishing rights.

On the other side are those who think the root of the crisis is a set of bureaucratic structures divorced from the American public's concerns and sense of justice, and the solution is to make criminal justice more community-focused. <br/><br/>This course will examine criminal justice reform from two theoretical perspectives.

Ethiopia Project: We will continue our work with our Ethiopian NGO partners in challenging the privately-owned Lega Dembi Gold Mine, which has poisoned the environment and devastated the lives and livelihoods of the indigenous agro-pastoral Guji people. In January and October 2019, clinic students traveled to Ethiopia to meet with our NGO partners and to interview victims, Guji elders, Ethiopian lawyers, health workers, mine employees, local university experts, and others; we may or may not return during Spring 2020 for further meetings and fact-finding. Thus far we have prepared reports to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review mechanism, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Procedures human rights complaint mechanism. Students traveled to Geneva in 2019 to participate in the CEDAW session and the UPR Pre-Session; during Spring 2020 we hope to participate in the Human Rights Council's full-day discussion of children's right to a healthy environment, including by organizing a side event during this session on the impacts on children of toxic contamination by extractive industries. We also hope to collaborate with Ethiopian attorneys on either litigation in Ethiopian courts or a complaint to the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. Students will also participate in our ongoing strategizing on how to move our advocacy work forward.<br/><br/>2. Migrants Rights Project: (a) The role of private security companies in the detention and other abusive treatment of migrants has elicited the concern of the UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries (WG), which is one of the UN Human Rights Council's Special Procedures. The WG has asked our clinic to prepare a comprehensive report on the role of private companies in the detention and other treatment of migrants fleeing, or trying to flee, across the U.S./Mexico border. The WG, which receives and responds to complaints of human rights violations relevant to their mandate, has encouraged us also to file complaints on behalf of individual migrants who are victims of human rights violations by these private security companies. This project will be a collaboration between Prof. Bridget Arimond's IHR Advocacy Clinic class and Prof. Carolyn Frazier's International Children's Rights Advocacy Clinic. Students working on this project will be involved in extensive research, interviewing, analysis and writing. It is anticipated that during Spring 2020 students working on this project will travel to one of the migrant detention centers to interview NGO advocates as well as, if possible, detained migrants themselves. (b) Students will also do research and analysis to explore the viability of a federal court class action lawsuit under the jurisdiction provided by the Alien Tort Statute, to recover damages for victims of the Trump Administration's 2018 family separation policy. If it is concluded that such a suit is viable, we will move ahead to file suit together with NGO and pro bono law firm partners.<br/><br/>3. LGBT Rights Project: Working in partnership with the NGO Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), we will prepare a report on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Uganda.

At the end of 11 weeks, you will walk out of this class with the tools and mindsets to succeed and flourish in your future careers - whether that's starting your own business, working at a Fortune 500 company, a nonprofit, or anything in between.This course satisfies the \"experiential course\" requirement for the Undergraduate Minor in Entrepreneurship."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "No special requirements or instructions.

The purpose is to expose students to a variety of skills necessary to advance as a researcher during and after their PhD studies. The topics of teaching and technical writing and presentation are incredibly important in a student's future success and yet are seldom taught in a systematic fashion in standard PhD curricula. This course addresses this need by tackling these topics drawing on the expertise of our own faculty. The course is about 1/2 seminar and 1/2 interactive discussion.

Chile was under a military dictatorship between 1973 and 1990, and its economy was influenced by the Chicago Boys in the 1970s and 1980s. And although the quality of life for Chileans has improved significantly over the last decades - supported by a stable economy, plenty of natural resources (especially copper) and political stability - the country still faces challenges tied directly and indirectly to money. Chile has a relatively low poverty rate, but it has a high income inequality rate. The country has an aging population and although its population is growing, it's doing so at a slower rate and that poses challenges for supporting the older generation.

By the end of the five weeks, students should have a strong understanding of how to take a large body of information, organize it and then create meaningful, gripping narratives across mediums. Guest speakers may include NPR reporters, documentary filmmakers, digital editors, advertising creatives and long-form writers.

And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful hold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean to be an \"author\" in the creative industries? What is the nature of creative work? How are artistic reputations constructed and understood? What role do critics and audiences play in that process? Why some media texts have authors and others don't? How does collaboration work in the creative industries? In this course we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the transmedia career of David Lynch. <br/><br/>Lynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media forms, encompassing visual art, film, television, photography, furniture design, popular music, online films, digital cinematography, and virtual reality. Lynch can be seen as the ultimate crossover artist: a cult filmmaker who went on to have a hit network television series (\"Twin Peaks\") the same year as winning the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Starting his career as a painter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After his first feature Eraserhead achieved the status of a cult classic on the \"midnight movie\" circuit, Lynch jumped into mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success with general audiences, cult fans, and academics. Films such as Blue Velvet became touchstones for film theorists during the 1980s, and are still discussed in academic circles today. Lynch has never been without his critics, and his work has come under fire for its depiction of women, sexual violence, race, and class. Lynch has often had creative control over his projects, and yet his distinctive \"Lynchian\" signature was forged through long-standing collaborative relationships with a cohort of actors, composers, editors, and sound designers. Lynch is thus a remarkably fertile case study for a consideration of media authorship, modes of collaboration in the creative industries, the history of film culture since the 1970s, the various logics of film, television, and digital media, the importance of sound design in audio-visual media, the representation of race, class, and gender, and a range of other issues."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "- Think critically and comparatively about the production practices of various media industries;<br/><br/>- Analyze the relationship between media authors and their social, cultural and historical context; <br/><br/>- Create critical commentary about a prominent media creator in the genre of the videographic essay;<br/><br/>- Better understand the nature of creative collaboration in the media industries."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be assessed through: 1) a portfolio of short response papers; 2) three short videographic essays made using Adobe Premiere and clips from Lynch's oeuvre; 3) in-class reading quizzes; 4) a short critical review of the new \"Twin Peaks\" VR experience,"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Chris Rodley ed., Lynch on Lynch<br/>Bernard Pomerance, The Elephant Man: A Play <br/>Justus Nieland, David Lynch<br/> <br/>Other readings available on Canvas."}]}, {"id": "32732", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "RTVF", "courseId": "322-0", "name": "Radio/Television/Film Genre", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Miriam B White"], "topic": "Romantic Comedy", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 15, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 17, "minute": 20}, "location": "Louis Hall 119"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This class considers the pleasures and perils of the romantic comedy, organized in short units that highlight specific aspects of the genre.

And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful hold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean to be an \"author\" in the creative industries? What is the nature of creative work? How are artistic reputations constructed and understood? What role do critics and audiences play in that process? Why so some media texts have authors and others don't? How does collaboration work in the creative industries? In this course we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the transmedia career of David Lynch. <br/><br/>Lynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media forms, encompassing visual art, film, television, photography, furniture design, popular music, online films, digital cinematography, and virtual reality. Lynch can be seen as the ultimate crossover artist: a cult filmmaker who went on to have a hit network television series (\"Twin Peaks\") the same year as winning the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Starting his career as a painter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After his first feature <em>Eraserhead</em> achieved the status of a cult classic on the \"midnight movie\" circuit, Lynch jumped into mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success with general audiences, cult fans, and academics. Films such as <em>Blue Velvet</em> became touchstones for film theorists during the 1980s, and are still discussed in academic circles today. Lynch has never been without his critics, and his work has come under fire for its depiction of women, sexual violence, race, and class. Lynch has often had creative control over his projects, and yet his distinctive \"Lynchian\" signature was forged through long-standing collaborative relationships with a cohort of actors, composers, editors, and sound designers. Lynch is thus a remarkably fertile case study for a consideration of media authorship, modes of collaboration in the creative industries, the history of film culture since the 1970s, the various logics of film, television, and digital media, the importance of sound design in audio-visual media, the representation of race, class, and gender, and a range of other issues."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the course students should be able to:<br/><ul><br/><li>Think critically and comparatively about the production practices of various media industries;</li><br/><li>Analyze the relationship between media authors and their social, cultural and historical context;</li><br/><li>Create critical commentary about a prominent media creator in the genre of the videographic essay;</li><br/><li>Better understand the nature of creative collaboration in the media industries.</li><br/></ul>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be assessed through: <br/><ol><br/><li>a portfolio of short response papers;</li><li>three short videographic essays made using Adobe Premiere and clips from Lynch's oeuvre;</li><li>in-class reading quizzes;</li><li>a short critical review of the new \"Twin Peaks\" VR experience,</li><br/></ol>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Chris Rodley ed., <cite>Lynch on Lynch</cite><br/>Bernard Pomerance, <cite>The Elephant Man: A Play</cite><br/>Justus Nieland, <cite>David Lynch</cite><br/><br/>Other readings available on Canvas."}]}, {"id": "31337", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "SoC", "subjectId": "SAI", "courseId": "401-0", "name": "Topics in Sound Production", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Stephan Michael Moore"], "topic": "Seminar in Sound Production", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu"], "start": {"hour": 17, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 20, "minute": 50}, "location": "Louis Hall 105"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The purpose of this seminar is to provide structure and support for students in the Sound Arts and Industries program toward the completion of their Study in Sound.

These plays include nonsensical stage directions, technically difficult feats, and censor-worthy content and explore complex themes like death, the supernatural, dreams, and nightmares through experimentation<br/> with form, style, and genre.<br/> <br/>This seminar focuses on a wide array of theatre movements during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries in Europe and North America that aimed to break away from traditional theatrical conventions and create new modes of representation onstage. Throughout<br/> the quarter, we will read dramas and manifestos that defined modern movements such as Realism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Expressionism, Futurism, Surrealism, Theatre of Cruelty, and Absurdism. We will discuss questions such as: is it possible to represent absence<br/> onstage? Can playwrights personify death without embodying it? Is narrative necessary for theatre? Can dramatists \"script\" chance or randomness? Students will be expected to contribute to classroom discussion, participate in creative group projects, and construct<br/> a final research paper.

Such shifts have been in part due to the rise of innovations in social enterprise. Engaging meaningfully in these organizations demands a thorough understanding of the sector landscape, a confidence employing strategic tools to advance sustainable change, and an active consideration of accountability in light of potential social transformations.<br/><br/>This course is designed to provide a survey of the civic engagement sector from a critical analytical perspective. After providing an overview of the sector, we will delve deeply into distinctive aspects of civic engagement such as youth as agents of change, sustainable impact, stakeholder engagement, philanthropy as a tool for social change, social innovation, models for global engagement, and more. We will focus on emerging models that provide novel approaches to sustainable engagement, and we will have the opportunity to explore the similarities, differences, and nuances of such approaches.

The second objective is explore why there is such variety in water insecurity worldwide. These discussions will be guided by the socio-ecological framework, in which dimensions ranging from the individual to the geopolitical are considered. Influences on access to water will be broadly considered; we will draw on literature in global health, ethnography, the life sciences, and public policy.

Power, weakness, wealth, poverty, beauty, savagery, knowledge, ignorance, light, darkness. We are all heirs of these incoherent visions; a bequest that appears in widely held and constantly renewed beliefs and assumptions about the \"Dark Continent.\" Visions of Africa today revolve largely around a set of tropes developed in the 19th century - Africa as benighted, undeveloped, female, chaotic, famine-ridden, and incapable of self-governance. However, as with all instances when one position gazes at another, the result is both accurate and inaccurate. In this class we will turn our gaze on contemporary Africa from a cultural anthropological perspective. Using the tools of anthropology we will visit several arenas critical to contemporary African cultures - music & dance, cinema, literature, sport, the body, technology, politics and development, among others. Through these various lenses we will attempt to better understand cultural choices and what we can say about Africa/ns from our perspective. That is, to recognize and value both internal and external views of the continent. Through these arenas and these perspectives we will better know issues of power, gender, hierarchy, spirituality, and economics. Will you arrive at an entirely accurate view of Africa and Africans? Never.

In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs?

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a \"global consciousness\" and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and techno science to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as \"humanity\" and \"species\" are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Ursula K.

Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life. <br/><br/>No prerequisites.

We will also focus on the achievements of singular individuals in history and consider the changing role of the artist in society over time. This latter topic is especially relevant in the sixteenth century when artistic biography emerged as a popular form of writing and, one could argue, art history as a discipline began to take shape. Additionally, we will investigate how art has responded to technology from the development of linear perspective in the early Renaissance period to the assimilation of advances in optical sciences in the Baroque era. Throughout the course, we will pay attention to the ways in which art reflects Europe's engagement with the wider globe, via colonialism, trade, and cultural exchange with Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

Following the worldwide year of revolution (1848) insurgent forces, appeared in the artistic no less than the political arena. They demanded the abolition or reorganization of the conservative academies of art with their restrictive jury systems. They rejected the idea of artistic subservience to wealthy or powerful patrons, insisting that the first responsibility of artists is to themselves and their imaginations. And they preferred to depict the popular classes - their struggles as well as their heroism - instead of the established cannon of stories from ancient history and myth, or the Christian bible. There were many artistic radicals in this period, but we will focus on just a few, including Gustave Courbet, Honore Daumier, Francois Millet and Edouard Manet in France and the Pre-Raphaelites in England. By the end of the century, a different crisis arose. The modernists had so far dominated the scene, that the risk arose that audiences would be left behind. So thoroughly had Symbolist artists such as Redon, Gauguin, Hodler, Van Gogh, Ensor and Munch rejected traditional subjects, that their work was becoming almost incomprehensible to audiences. Even erstwhile Impressionists such as Monet, Degas and Cezanne confronted a crisis: Would they follow their own, creative and interrogative path wherever it led them, of would they retreat to more solid ground, surrendering the very idea of progress and experimentation?

Last year, for example, a group called \"Decolonize this Place\" protested at the Whitney Museum of American Art, challenging both the financial affiliations of a prominent board member and the diversity of artists collected by a museum meant to represent American art, broadly speaking. While groups like \"Decolonize this Place\" participate in a long history of cultural practice called \"institutional critique\" and engage in extra-muros activist strategies, curators and other museum employees are now also engaged in this self-critical project. Indeed, these concerns are forefront in the Block Museum of Art's plans for an exhibition of contemporary art drawn from its own permanent collection and tentatively titled \"Thinking about History.\" Focused on artists who shape, present, and represent the past in their work, the exhibition also aspires to present a self-critical analysis of its own strategies for shaping its collection and promoting a set of social values in an educational context. This seminar will take up similar concerns. Looking at a history of critical museum studies and art associated with \"institutional critique,\" the course asks questions about the politics of museum finances; the ideological underpinnings of inclusion and exclusion; canon formation; boycotts; and what it means to \"decolonize\" the museum in relationship both to the history it presents and the futures it maps. The course culminates in the extraordinary opportunity for students to decide upon the purchase of a work of contemporary art for the Block's permanent collection that the group selects from local galleries and justifies to museum staff, arguing for the merits of the work, its relevance to the Block's teaching mission, and its relationship to \"Thinking about History.\" Students are required to attend one Saturday class visit to contemporary art galleries in the Chicago area, and some seminar sessions will be held off campus visiting museums and private collections.

Feed-back from your fellow students in class discussion will improve your paper project.

You can only do this if you prepare the assigned readings, take reading notes, review your notes before class, and bring your notes with you to the class room. While they are not graded individually, your two-page review of Quelling the People in week two will feature into your discussion grade as well as the first two in-progress versions of your final paper in weeks five and seven. You will prepare and raise a discussion question once at the beginning of a class meeting. I encourage you to read during our nine weeks of classes a weekly magazine or a newspaper of your choice for reporting on civic activists, surveillance, censorship, or another aspect of authoritarian rule in China, for example the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Guardian. To shine in class discussion, you must be present. Absence, unless excused by medical reasons, and repeated late arrival to class will harm your grade. We are fallible and we all make mistakes, so you can miss one class meeting and be late once to class unexcused without consequences for your discussion grade. 35% For your mid-term exam in week four, I will give you at least three questions of which you will answer two in a total of 1,500 to 1,600 words.

What alternative vision of China informs and animates activists' videos? How effective is a given video as a political weapon? How does the Chinese state portray your activists? What value judgments underlie the portrayals of your activists by Western reporters and professors? You will answer these questions for one or several Chinese videos subtitled in English (or any other language you happen to understand) that you find independently and that are not already assigned on the syllabus. You will search for English-language press coverage of the activists who made the videos as well as for scholarly articles or books on the activists. If you find nothing on your activists in the press nor in scholarship, you will relate your chosen activists and their initiatives to the scholarship we have read in class to see whether Western reporters and professors share activists' standards for evaluating life and politics in China. You will share two early, preliminary drafts of your paper with your classmates for feedback and meet with me one-on-one to discuss your writing.

In addition, because of the genetic variation at the two genetic loci that control mating, it is estimated that there are over 23,000 \"sexes\" in this fungus! In this course, students will learn key aspects of the biology of Schizophyllum (and several other fungi) and will carry out experiments to examine the extraordinary natural genetic variation that this organism has undergone. Every experiment will be designed to discover new knowledge. Each student will be provided with specimens from a nation-wide collection of wild S. commune specimens with which to carry out molecular, genetic, and genomic experiments and analyses. Each student will also analyze Schizophyllum specimens that she/he has found in the local environment. Working with Professor Gaber, students will generate new mutations, determine the molecular sequences of the genes that control mushroom mating, and perform molecular \"barcoding\" to establish phylogenetic relationships between members of the Schizophyllum population. They will also screen a nation-wide collection of Schizophyllum to investigate the genetic and phenotypic variation exhibited by this organism."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value":

In doing so, we will practice assessing the power relations and social inequalities embedded in each issue.

Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities were thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life. <br/><br/>This course will survey key aspects of the evidence, which will include a discussion of current archaeological techniques and fieldwork. The course will also discuss the 18th century uncovering of Campania's cities, which is a story in its own right. Contemporaries were sometimes shocked by what they found.

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, Rita Laura Segato, Ver\u00f3nica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a \"potencia feminista\" (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as \"zapatismo\" and its political principle of \"governing obeying\"?<br/><br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a \"knowledge dispositive\" (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to Mar\u00eda Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-G\u00f3me, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Preliminary Bibliography<br/><br/>Dussel, Enrique, Twenty Thesis of Politics, Duke University Press, Durham, 2008.

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power and weakness. To what extent does seduction affirm an unequal gender logic? Does seduction always imply violence? This seminar aims to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction in a variety of literary, psychoanalytical, and philosophical texts. We will start by considering one of the central mythical figures of modernity, Don Juan, in Moli\u00e8re and Da Ponte's retellings of the story, where seduction takes the form of a gendered performance. Paying particular attention to the theoretical interventions of Shoshana Felman and Judith Butler, we will explore the imaginative links between gender, performance, and seduction.<br/><br/>Our reading of Choderlos de Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons will revolve around the question of how the narrative may be said to complicate or even reverse earlier cultural assumptions about gender and seduction. We then will investigate \"The Diary of a Seducer\" in Kierkegaard's Either/Or, which interprets seduction as the lynchpin between the aesthetic and the ethical, pleasure and the law. Finally, we will reflect in what ways the very history of psychoanalysis has been marked by the discovery of seduction?of a child by an adult?thus establishing a connection to trauma that Freud initially acknowledged and then denied. Through readings of essays by Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, and Masson, we will discuss how psychoanalysis has responded to the scandal of seduction by problematizing ethical, and normative solutions to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness and has regarded seduction as foundational in the development of the human subject. <br/><br/>Works by Moli\u00e8re, Laclos, Mueller, Kierkegaard, Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, Masson, Felman, and Butler.<br/><br/>Taught seminar style.

Inspired by both classical and modern readings about strategy, we develop and employ game theory tools to study firm behavior in a variety of scenarios, beginning with static (one period) models, and then turning to dynamic settings, in which firms may pursue profits through mergers, R&D investments, or the timing of a product launch. We also explore pricing schemes as well as tactics managers might use to modify the business environment in ways that enhance their firms' long-run profits.

Surveying a range of literature, film, and television from Dracula to Star Trek, we will track the developments of ideas about race, science and technology, sexuality and gender, and national identities as they appear in science fiction and fantasy, preparing you for your own role as a thoughtful participant in popular culture and academic research."}]}, {"id": "33574", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "105-0", "name": "Expository Writing", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Haijing   Jiang"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 11, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 12, "minute": 20}, "location": "University Hall 312"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The Seven Deadly Sins: Pride, Envy, Greed, Lust, Gluttony, Anger and Sloth. While our current society may consider some of these vices trivial, sexy, or downright virtuous, medieval people saw them as direct tickets to hell. Our course will explore the various literary and popular representations of these sins, their transformation from the medieval to modern period, and the possible virtues they generated along the way. We will survey how medieval writers and thinkers first taught the Seven Deadly Sins and their corresponding virtues, while questioning whether these lessons have persisted in our present era. By reading translations of some medieval works, such as bawdy Old French comic tales and epic Middle English dream visions, along with modern authors ranging from Roald Dahl to Jeffrey Eugenides, we will explore the creative ways these vices and virtues have interacted with each other across media, cultures and ages. Our goal is not simply to understand how or why these particular qualities have captured our imaginations for centuries: we will also examine the methods writers used to ensure that their version of the vices and virtues would endure. In doing so, we will ask critical questions about ethics, religion, gender and history, all the while becoming more savvy and astute close-readers of our world today."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Gerald Graff & Cathy Birkenstein, They Say, I Say: Moves that Matter in Academic Writing. 3rd Edition (ISBN: 978-0393935844)<br/><br/>Roald Dahl, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (ISBN: 978-0142410318) <br/><br/>Jeffrey Eugenides, The Virgin Suicides (ISBN: 78-1250303547)"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Registration for this course is not handled by the English department. <br/><br/>Questions about this course should be directed to the The Cook Family Writing Program.<br/>writing-program@northwestern.edu"}]}, {"id": "33575", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "105-6", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Lisa M Del Torto"], "topic": "Sustaining Sociolinguistic Diversity", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 14, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 15, "minute": 20}, "location": "555 Clark 230"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Scholars of language and writing argue that language and its modes, varieties, genres, and rhetorical strategies are always shifting, flexible, and contested.

Students will formulate and consider their own questions about sociolinguistic diversity, equity, and inclusion in papers and presentations.

On the other, maybe for that very reason, comedy has rarely gotten the same kind of serious attention as other forms of writing and performance, and some of its sharpest theorists are also its greatest creators. Is it the same as what is funny? Is it just a happy ending? What is happiness, anyway? Who knows? This two-thousand-year indecision makes comedy an ideal topic for a course to explore tactics of reading and interpretation. We will read comedies from Aristophanes to modern sit comes, and weigh against them some of comedy's theories, including formal, historical, social, anthropological, and psychological approaches."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Mostly discussion-based."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Several short writing assignments; final project"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Aristophanes, Birds; Terence, Eunuchus; Shakespeare, As You Like It; Behn, The Rover; Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest; Gleason, The Honeymooners; Stoppard, Arcadia; Vogel, How I Learned to Drive<br/><br/>Texts will be available at: Beck's."}]}, {"id": "36727", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "300-0", "name": "Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "sectionNumber": "21", "instructors": ["Anne Lisbet Boemler"], "topic": "Bad Books", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 12, "minute": 30}, "end": {"hour": 13, "minute": 50}, "location": "Harris Hall L04"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "What makes a book bad?

Woolf); the Great War (1914-1918) shattered millions of lives, marked \"the end of a civilization,\" dismantled an outworn social order, and created hope to rebuild European civilization \"on firmer ground and more lastingly\" (Freud). The ensuing contest between liberal democracy and rising totalitarianisms led to World War II.<br/><br/>Bloomsbury thinkers and artists debated the century's new challenges across a range of disciplines during this period of rapid technological and social change. We'll study Virginia Woolf's major novels and essays alongside selected contemporaries' writings about the 1910 Post-Impressionist Exhibition; the women's movement and suffrage campaign; pacifism, world war, the Versailles peace conference; British imperialism at home and abroad; the Spanish Civil War; Nazism, fascism, the early years of WWII; the texture of everyday lived experience. An adventurous writer of fiction and essays, Woolf is also a theorist in the sense evoked by the Greek word theoria: \"a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle\" (OED).

As we respond to these questions, we will explore and critique ideas on postcolonial ecocritical thought (e.g., work by Elizabeth Deloughrey, Amitav Ghosh, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Rob Nixon, Cajetan Iheka, and Byron Caminero-Santangelo).

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a \"global consciousness\" and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and technoscience to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as \"humanity\" and \"species\" are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament.<br/><br/>Open to students in Environmental Policy and Culture during Pre-registration"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Chapters will be assigned from the books listed, and most will be in PDF format.

Students gain an understanding of questions relating to social inequalities and diversities from a \"French Global\" perspective, while focusing on French definitions and experiences of (in)equality and diversity, and how these play out in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation.

As its etymological derivation from the Latin seducere makes evident, seduction signifies the threat of being led astray, suggesting a problematic reorganization of boundaries, activity and passivity, power and weakness. To what extent does seduction affirm an unequal gender logic? Does seduction always imply violence? This seminar aims to confront these questions by revisiting primal scenes of seduction in a variety of literary, psychoanalytical, and philosophical texts. We will start by considering one of the central mythical figures of modernity, Don Juan, in Moli\u00e8re and Da Ponte's retellings of the story, where seduction takes the form of a gendered performance. Paying particular attention to the theoretical interventions of Shoshana Felman and Judith Butler, we will explore the imaginative links between gender, performance, and seduction.<br/><br/>Our reading of Choderlos de Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons will revolve around the question of how the narrative may be said to complicate or even reverse earlier cultural assumptions about gender and seduction. We then will investigate \"The Diary of a Seducer\" in Kierkegaard's Either/Or, which interprets seduction as the lynchpin between the aesthetic and the ethical, pleasure and the law. Finally, we will reflect in what ways the very history of psychoanalysis has been marked by the discovery of seduction?of a child by an adult?thus establishing a connection to trauma that Freud initially acknowledged and then denied. Through readings of essays by Freud, Ferenczi, Laplanche, and Masson, we will discuss how psychoanalysis has responded to the scandal of seduction by problematizing ethical, and normative solutions to the drama of dissymmetry and otherness and has regarded seduction as foundational in the development of the human subject."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Taught seminar style.

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, Rita Laura Segato, Ver\u00f3nica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a \"potencia feminista\" (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as \"zapatismo\" and its political principle of \"governing obeying\"?<br/><br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a \"knowledge dispositive\" (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to Mar\u00eda Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-G\u00f3me, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Preliminary Bibliography<br/><br/>Dussel, Enrique, Twenty Thesis of Politics, Duke University Press, Durham, 2008.

Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded to the Nazi onslaught in ways similar and divergent. Sexism was also an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

What were the goals of the university at its founding? How did the university relate to the town within which it exists? How has the university changed over time, and how does that reflect changes in higher education-in the case of Northwestern, from the Pre-Civil War period to the present? For whom were universities created, and who do universities serve today? When and why did it become important for non-elite people to attain a college degree?

The transformation of the continent was far, however, from an unending or inexorable story of progress. In the intervening centuries national states supplanted diverse empires and forcibly assimilated or violently purged ethnic minorities. The European powers conquered most of the world and reluctantly relinquished it only after the devastation of two world wars and bitter struggles for decolonization. In the wake of Nazi Germany's defeat, Europeans embarked on an unprecedented and remarkably successful project of economic and political unification that over the past decade has confronted economic crises, divisions over mass migration, and the rise of new authoritarian movements.

The goal of this course is to give students the opportunity to gain wider theoretical and empirical knowledge about several genocides that took place in different parts of the world (North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia), focusing mostly on the twentieth century cases of the Herero Genocide, the Holocaust, and Cambodia. The course will also examine the precursors of twentieth century genocides, by focusing on the destruction of Native Americans during the centuries of European colonization, which remains an under-researched and much debated topic, with major implications for today's American society. For decades, the Holocaust and the terror of the Khmer Rouge regime (Cambodia) have represented examples of mass atrocity that have affected millions of innocent civilians, with the aim of eliminating groups of people in whole or in part. The first genocide of the twentieth century, the destruction of the Herrero and Nama (in present-day Namibia) by the German Imperial Army is a lesser known case of genocide - it was almost forgotten until the boom in mass violence research in the 1990s - and yet crucially important to understand the ways in which the colonial driven destruction of indigenous people continued into the twentieth century and how it influenced the emergence of the Holocaust. <br/>In order to provide in-depth explanations and increase knowledge about the character of genocide, one therefore needs to place specific events in their proper historical, cultural, social, political, ideological and other contexts.

We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

By and large, however, those trials concentrated on crimes of political collaboration and paid little attention to what is now accepted as the Nazis' greatest crime: the genocide of European Jewry. Although courts did punish some architects of the so-called Final Solution, thousands of Europeans who had organized, perpetrated or otherwise contributed to the Holocaust escaped with minimal penalties or no punishment at all. Over the subsequent decades individuals, organizations, and states have sought to redress the failure to seek out and punish those perpetrators at war's end. Lawyers have prosecuted and defended accused war criminals before courts. Historians have documented the development and execution of genocide, while others have sought to deny the very murders themselves.

While debates over the value and dangers of the concept look back to the Greeks, the prescriptive claims of our century take for granted the institutional, technological, political, spatial, and communicative developments associated with the rise of public cultures since the eighteenth-century. Historians in this conversation tend to focus on the processes of contact (between cultures, goods, and peoples) with an acute attention to power. For Europeanists in particular, modern cosmopolitanism has lived in the shadows of imperialism and the nation-state. Hence, while sharing the aspirations of cosmopolitan ideals, historical research typically introduces skeptical caution. This seminar will bring together the historical research that have both directly and indirectly this question in critical conversations with philosophers and political theorists of the new cosmopolitanism like David Held, Martha Nussbaum, Kwame Anthony Appiah. Some historical themes to be examined include: capitalist connoisseurship, worldly citizenship in revolutionary transformations, anthropological knowledge, the technological and commercial developments of mass information and entertainment, searches for colonial exoticism/erotic diversity/sexual dissidence in metropolitan cities, diasporic displacements and de-colonization."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion, Presentations, Short Book Reviews, Final Essay.<br/>Tentative syllabus available by request"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All readings will be available on Canvas"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "History Area of Concentration: European"}]}, {"id": "32349", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "HISTORY", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "01", "instructors": ["Kenneth L Alder"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": "TBA", "start": "TBA", "end": "TBA", "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "32350", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "HISTORY", "courseId": "490-0", "name": "Independent Reading", "sectionNumber": "02", "instructors": ["Michael J.

The Copernican turn and geological notions of deep time, for example, radically shifted understandings of the Earth, time, and humans' relationship to them. Whole Earth images first generated by the Apollo Space missions in the late 1960s and 1970s have been the characteristic form of planetary imagination during the late twentieth century. Earthrise and The Blue Marble images enabled humans to imagine the planet as an interconnected whole against the backdrop of the Cold War and environmental disasters. They have been crucial to the emergence of a \"global consciousness\" and became famous icons of the global environmental movement, depicting the planet as the common home of humans as one species. The power of these images has not decreased, yet other forms of representation and imagination have emerged as well. The development of Google Earth or advanced climate modeling systems, for example, mark a different notion of Earth, characterized by dynamic, heterogeneous, and open systems. This course examines such shifting notions of the Earth by tracing how practices and discourses of geopolitics, political theory, cartography, population studies, climate modeling, deep ocean sensing, outer space exploration and mining, and science fiction literature, have come to sense, know, represent, and imagine the planet since the 18th century. In doing so, this course also surveys shifting socio-political currents, from the intersection of the military-industrial complex and technoscience to how climate crisis, Anthropocene debates, and Earth Systems analysis reflect further shifts in the ways the planet is understood today. Tracing these shifts in planetary representation and imagination is also crucial to understanding how core concepts such as \"humanity\" and \"species\" are made and unmade. Understanding the deeply mediated processes behind planetary depictions is not only central to making sense of contemporary politics and policies that propose to shape the future, but also to imagining alternative worlds and futures beyond our grim ecological predicament."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Chapters will be assigned from the books listed, and most will be in PDF format.

course will examine the roots and the drivers of Putin's foreign policy. It will look at the factors leading to the USSR's disintegration and resulting ethnic conflicts, the security issues requiring responses from the U.S., and the decision-making processes in responding to these challenges. <br/><br/>The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the twentieth century's last in a series of collapses of multinational empires, and it presented the U.S. with the most difficult security challenges. In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. <br/><br/>The course also will examine the security environment of the post-Cold War world, with a focus on Russia's efforts to assert what it sees as its right to a sphere of influence. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has proven deeply skeptical of Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU. Closer to home, it has employed various direct and indirect efforts to undermine Western solidarity and confidence in the liberal democratic system.<br/><br/>As a final project, students will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be required to write a midterm book review of one of the required books, and, as a final project, they will propose possible U.S. responses to a resurgent Russia"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "One of the following: <br/><br/>A World Transformed, by George Bush and Brent Scowcroft<br/>At the Highest Levels, by Michael R.

We will reflect on the reasons why individuals choose to become mobile, as well as the structural conditions that might compel them. Specifically, we will look at disparities between urban and rural populations, clashes over ownership of job markets in urban settings, and the formation of individual and collective migrant identities. The course will begin by studying how waves of migrants (within and across frontiers) after independence shaped contemporary ideologies of race and belonging in Latin America, and end with a reflection on what these trajectories can teach us about studying Latin American migrants in the \"Global North\" today.

This course focuses on health disparities and differentiated mortality rates in order to tackles issues of (il)legality, citizenship, and integration among contemporary displaced communities around the world. It proposes to investigate people's lives and deaths in times of displacement and indeterminacy to ask: What legal and political constraints reinforce health disparities and social inequalities among displaced communities? To what extent refugees' appeal for rights to citizenship and to health can go beyond the conventional forms of sovereign state power? What are the benefits and limits of (non)governmental organizations' services for displaced communities? Knowledge of these efforts calls attention to the achievements and shortcomings of humanitarianism, the lesser-recognized ways that displaced communities heal and survive political and environmental instabilities, and the possible approaches that governmental authorities and the international community could implement in their agenda for the global displacement crisis. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary and research-intensive course uses ethnographic studies to model successful qualitative research designs for students.

Reviled in these traditional communities as \"heretics\" they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This \"imagined community\" was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly. <br/>It was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the \"Talush\" (\"the uprooted man\") which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety.<br/>The course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day. In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national \"Home\" brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the \"Talush\" narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y.

We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as well as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East.

In this course, we examine the historically and geographically specific constellations of borders and ask: How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? Who gets to draw these lines? Is a state border a given result of a natural and ethnic contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs?

First, you will learn about the three fundamental approaches to ethics and you will develop your own arguments using tools from these approaches throughout the course. Having done this, you will be prepared to enter any ethics class with a detailed familiarity with the basic concepts of philosophical ethics. Second, you will be introduced to a very important and broad research project in ethics by engaging directly with literature about our moral obligations to \"distant\" individuals and situations such as persons living in far away countries, persons not yet born, and future disasters. This will give you the tools to analyze many issues that are unique to climate change. And third, throughout the course you will examine contemporary real-world choices we face collectively and individually. In doing so, you will hone your understanding of the ethical approaches we discuss as well as your skills of argument analysis, and you will sharpen your own views on many practically important issues."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Paper, finalAttendanceClass participationGroup workReadingsPaper, mid-term"}]}, {"id": "30848", "termId": "4780", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "PHIL", "courseId": "273-3", "name": "The Brady Scholars Program: The Good Society", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Anne W Eaton"], "topic": "The Good Society", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 14, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 15, "minute": 20}, "location": "University Library 3670"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "What are the markers of a good society, and in particular of a just society?

Social psychologists examine how people interpret the social world and investigate the influence of the social environment on individuals' thoughts and behaviors. We will examine classic topics in social psychology: social cognition, social influence, conformity, group processes, interpersonal relationships, helping, aggression, and prejudice. There will be a strong emphasis on methodology and the ways in which study design affects both the research questions one can answer and the conclusions one might draw. Because social psychologists sometimes investigate \"everyday\" behavior, students often believe that they can rely on intuition or common sense to learn about social psychology.

But what if what I experience, feel, suffer, or even imagine, has actually never happened to me? Do experiences belong exclusively to someone or are they somehow collective? Can I feel, or perhaps share, the pain (and joy) of others? Can I give voice to somebody else's experience, if not out of identification, at least out of empathy? How ethical or opportunistic would that be? At the same time, what if I cannot properly articulate my own experiences without imagining the experience of others? What happens when I realize that my own feelings derive from somebody else's narrated experience? In short, what are the boundaries between appropriation of the other's experience and authentic identification? <br/>According to the Oxford Dictionary, vicarious refers to that which is experienced \"through the feelings or actions of another person.\" Similarly, in \"vicarious fictions,\" the narrator, or even the author, appropriates someone else's experience in order to produce accounts of their own lives and selves. In many cases, they vicariously narrate distant historical events - such as dictatorships, wars, and genocides - as they were witnessed by someone else. In this course we will read a number of Latin American novels that emerged in the last two decades (2000-2018), in which the narrators put themselves in someone else's shoes, and yet, do not appropriate or ventriloquize the other. Their narrators or protagonists often relive or reenact events that may seem distant, temporally and/or spatially, but which still resonate in contemporary lives as part of the collective imagination. They may also revisit historical periods through the lenses of a narrator who is affected by events which they did neither live or witness; they might instead have heard if from their parents, a friend, or even read about it in the newspaper or history books. By reading such vicarious fictions, we will reflect upon issues of cultural heritage, historical subjectivity and identity.

Latin American Philosophy was born out of aims to understand to how geopolitical conditions produced intellectual coloniality - understood as the impossibility of reaching an age of majority due to dependence on western thinking. Most recently, Latin American critical theorists ? such as Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, Rita Laura Segato, Ver\u00f3nica Gago, and the Zapatistas,? have asked : What discourses of power lie behind the understanding of Latina American as otherness to Europe? What is the relation between war and the increase of femicide? How do aesthetic practices, social movements, and the exercise of memory change politics? How can those practices be understood as part of a \"potencia feminista\" (feminist potency)? With which theoretical sources should we understand Latin American experiences such as \"zapatismo\" and its political principle of \"governing obeying\"? <br/>In this course, we will understand how the Philosophy of Liberation, and other Latin American productions, form part of a \"knowledge dispositive\" (a term in dialogue with the French philosophy Foucault) engaging the political needs of colonial and colonized nations. Students who have enjoyed the study of foundational critical theorists as Marx, Nietszsche and Freud (and frameworks such as historical materialism/genealogy and psychoanalysis) will encounter of authors in critical dialogue with these methodologies. This is a creative dialogue, given that theories produced in western traditions do not always attend to the current reality in Latin American countries. We will consider how gender-based critique has formed an important part of recent Latin American critical theory and address the role of race, gender, and class intersectional critique in this context.<br/><br/>Thus, the course moves from Anibal Quijano's critique of coloniality of power to Mar\u00eda Lugones' critique of this category in light of her parallel account of a modern gender system. We will study projects to overcome intellectual coloniality by concentrating on the debate, and differences, between Dussel and Santiago Castro-G\u00f3me, and their respective theories of a philosophy of liberation and a genealogy of coloniality Further keywords from this course on decoloniality and critical theory include gore capitalism, coloniality and transmodernity, potentia/potestas, endebtedness, and baroque identity."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Preliminary Bibliography<br/>Dussel, Enrique, Twenty Thesis of Politics, Duke University Press, Durham, 2008.
