Students with a music major, or a dual degree with music, are not permitted to register for this seminar. The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts - you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six to eight hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions. During and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus - during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life. After Week One's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice). Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CDs will learn a variety of conducting techniques - mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate interpretation, phrasing, dynamic shading. You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Textbook TBD."}]}, {"id": "25239", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "MUSIC", "subjectId":

ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. <br/><br/>This course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.<br/><br/>In ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow ? the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc.<br/><br/>Topics Include:<br/><br/>? Steady viscous flows (exact solutions)<br/> Poiseuille flow in round pipes<br/> Couette flow between parallel plates<br/>?

Whether it's deciding how to save to pay for an education or how much money a government should spend on social services, money is front and center. <br/><br/>In Chile, like other countries, decisions about money have been impacted by politics. Chile was under a military dictatorship between 1973 and 1990, and its economy was influenced by the Chicago Boys in the 1970s and 1980s. And although the quality of life for Chileans has improved significantly over the last decades - supported by a stable economy, plenty of natural resources (especially copper) and political stability - the country still faces challenges tied directly and indirectly to money. Chile has a relatively low poverty rate, but it has a high income inequality rate. The country has an aging population and although its population is growing, it's doing so at a slower rate and that poses challenges for supporting the older generation. More women are entering the workforce, but Chile has a relatively low rate of female employment. Mining is a key contributor to the country's economy, but younger Chileans favor jobs in the e-commerce, digital and financial industries. <br/><br/>In this course, students will look at what influences Chilean residents when they make decisions about money: how they make it, how they spend it, how they save it.

It is often said, particularly now, that the right to vote is what keeps the United States from descending into autocracy or one-party rule. Yet, the right to vote is not protected directly in the Constitution, and American history is filled with examples of successful ways for those in power, at both national and local levels, to keep and entrench their power by manipulating THE VOTE. A core purpose of the course is to brief students on how this has been done in the U.S. and to prepare them to know it when they see it and to report on it or otherwise address it. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Among the topics we will cover are: <br/><br/>The Vote, the Constitution and its Amendments, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the end of the Voting Rights Act: Origins and traditions throughout the U.S. that have limited the vote to property-owning white men until the 15th Amendment in 1870; denied generations of women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 50 years later in 1920; and ended in 2013 the Voting Rights Act protections against racial discrimination in voting that were enacted 48 years earlier in 1965. <br/><br/>Immigration and demographics: Selective limits and bans on lawful migration into the U.S. and on naturalizations have reduced the numbers and types of people allowed to enter and stay in the country and become citizens who can vote. <br/><br/>Voter suppression: Techniques used by states, ostensibly to address potential vote fraud, such as disqualifying felons and ex-felons from voting, poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and other Jim Crow laws; requiring photo IDs; purging voter rolls when registered voters don't vote in consecutive elections; using unverified crosscheck lists to create the impression of illegal duplicate voting; limiting early voting; closing targeted polling places, all of which tend to disproportionately impact minorities, African-American communities, lower-income residents, majority-Hispanic districts, and senior citizens; and the Supreme Court decisions in Bush v. Gore (2000) and Rucho v. Common Cause (2019). <br/><br/>Voter registration, turnout and non-voters: The predictable limits that have produced a nation in which voting tends to include only about 60% of the voting eligible population for presidential elections, about 40% for midterm elections, and about 25% in municipal elections. <br/><br/>Census: Every ten years, the census bureau does its most intensive count of the U.S. population. The data is used to draw district boundaries for the purposes of determining Congressional and state legislative maps. One issue for this coming 2020 census is the citizenship question, which the Supreme Court recently addressed in U.S. Commerce Dept. v. New York (2019) and which we will dissect to understand the relationship between the census, demographic reality and elections to come. <br/><br/>Redistricting, gerrymandering and the Electoral College: It is legal for politicians to draw district boundaries for partisan political purposes, but not for racial reasons. That distinction was recently reinforced in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), with the Supreme Court deciding 5-4 that intended political fixes should continue to be legal. One consequence of political gerrymandering is it allows for those in power who draw and approve the redistricting maps to further entrench their political ideologies and parties. <br/><br/>The Russians are coming: They came, they saw and they corrupted. Why stop now and have others, from other countries to domestic disrupters, learned the art and tricks of social media saturation? <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Each week, we will approach these recurring phenomena through four lenses: <br/><br/>Historical: We will revisit the roots and recurrences in the evolution of voting trends and strategies. <br/><br/>Legal: We will extract and examine the prevailing legislation, legal cases, and principles that guide or dictate election laws and results. <br/><br/>Global: We will be mindful of how the U.S. is similar to and different from other countries. <br/><br/>Happenin': We will bring it all together by scoping out and analyzing current controversies to be better positioned to anticipate and fight back against brazen efforts to perpetuate power and thwart democratic representation and values."}]}, {"id": "26669", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "JOUR", "subjectId": "JOUR", "courseId": "390-0", "name": "Special Topics", "sectionNumber": "26", "instructors": ["Christopher D'Angelo Benson"], "topic": "Framed: Media and the Marginalized", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 11, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 12, "minute": 20}, "location": "Fisk Hall 311"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Stereotypes.

The disaster and the government's lackluster response shined light on issues that had long plagued Puerto Rico: poverty and unemployment, poor infrastructure, environmental injustice and lack of political power. The devastation added to the crisis caused by the island's crippling debt, which caused the government to close schools and cut government employment, social services and health care, even as the island has suffered public health crises, including high rates of heroin addiction and HIV infection. <br/> <br/>Almost two years later, thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets demanding a change in government after the Puerto Rico Center for Investigative Journalism revealed serious corruption and text messages showing mockery and disdain for the general public from then-Governor Ricardo Rossello and his colleagues. The massive protests ? coming on the heels of demonstrations by teachers, women's rights activists and other groups - have launched a movement for wholesale political and social change. <br/> <br/>In this context, long-standing problems and the popular resistance movements to address them continue. Environmental contamination is a serious problem, including from toxic coal ash dumps and decades of U.S. military weapons testing. And even as the hurricane caused devastation, it cleared the way for gentrification and hence displacement in desirable areas like San Juan, the Afro-Caribbean coast of Loiza and the tiny island of Vieques. <br/> <br/>In this course, you will learn about and report on such current issues on the island and also affecting Chicago's Puerto Rican community. Before the Medill Explores trip, the course will involve learning about Puerto Rico's history and current issues through news coverage, guest speakers and multimedia, with students producing brief written reflections. This is a reporting course with the goal of each student producing a published piece after the trip. The class after the trip will be focused on workshopping and completing stories. The course will also involve collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism in San Juan, the journalists who facilitated the latest wave of popular revolt. <br/> <br/>Our time in Puerto Rico will involve multiple group reporting visits and interviews with sources on a range of issues, as well as some time for students to report on their own. We will be based in picturesque Old San Juan as well as the island of Vieques. We will visit and report in the rural mountainous areas hard-hit by the hurricane and energy loss; rural coastal areas affected by pollution; and urban areas dealing with socioeconomic issues. <br/> <br/>Visits will likely include an estuary community facing extreme contamination and flooding; an Afro-Puerto Rican community struggling to hold on to its beach-front land; the famous and embattled San Juan neighborhood where the Despacito video was recorded; needle exchange groups serving drug users on the streets; a sustainable farming project; an environmental justice project in a remote mountain village; a theater troupe using art to build resilience; the Center for Investigative Journalism; and various sites in Vieques.

General topics of interest include dam dismantling, ocean-specific wave energy, and the cost of mitigating and/or adapting to climate change.<br/><br/>Tribal specific topics crystallize many of the issues that impact the wider community. These include fisheries management, erosion and sustainable agriculture. Many communities share Native interests in the resurgence of canoe culture and food sovereignty.Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become increasingly salient, as indigenous communities struggle to defend their air, water, and other natural resources; protect their access to traditional foods; and adapt to changes in their landscapes.

Essence work also enables all artists to contribute more deeply to the creative process, and to take greater ownership over the production. In addition to a close investigation of Essence Work, students will study and execute specific rehearsal exercises and techniques employed by brilliant international artists like choreographer Pina Bausch and French director Ariane Mnouchkine.

By examining characteristics of youth and community programs in the fields of education, social justice, human development, health promotion, human rights, and civic engagement - at the local, national, and international levels - we will seek to identify commonalities and understand differences among them. A key goal of this course is to acquire an intellectual and applied understanding of the principles of program design and development, which include a sustained consideration of issues affecting the quality of program implementation. Considerable attention will be devoted to specific steps within the design and implementation process, as well as case studies of actual programs. We will examine a range of topics, including: finding inspiration; identification, recruitment, and retention of target audiences; staff selection; setting global and incremental goals; and ensuring sustainability. We must also acknowledge that what counts as a social need or social problem is subjective and complex and that programs can therefore be controversial, difficult to manage, and difficult to evaluate. In light of this, we will touch on the organizational, ethical, and political contexts of implementation. While much of the design and implementation process can be seen as intuitive, you are encouraged - through class discussion, your writing, and your designs - to actively challenge your assumptions about creating community programming, as well as critique the programs that we learn about and the design techniques that we practice."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationProject, finalWriting assignments"}]}, {"id": "27595", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "SESP", "subjectId": "SESP", "courseId": "317-0", "name": "Gender and the Life Course", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Regina Lopata Logan"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 12, "minute": 30}, "end": {"hour": 13, "minute": 50}, "location": "Annenberg Hall 345"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course, we will consider how gender influences the major stages of the life course.

Correlations help to predict outcomes, but if we want to influence outcomes we need to understand the causal pathways. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening.<br/><br/>In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. <br/><br/>The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-in-difference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. <br/><br/>Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (a.k.a. \"happiness\") are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people's lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors, social, and environmental conditions. This means they can be improved via social policies. For the development of the most effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. <br/><br/>In terms of applications, we will discuss fetal origins (the impact of pregnancy conditions and health at birth on later life outcomes), the impact of air pollution on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, causes and consequences of mental health in children and youth, the impact of income on health, the roots of midlife crisis, and happiness across countries and over time."}]}, {"id": "26786", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "SESP", "subjectId": "SOC_POL", "courseId": "351-0", "name": "Special Topics in Social Policy", "sectionNumber": "22", "instructors": ["Quinn Weber Mulroy"], "topic": "Policy in Times of Political Transformation", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 14, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 15, "minute": 20}, "location": "Annenberg Hall G02"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course (designed for students interested in the relationship between social policy and political change), we will consider the policy consequences of recent transformations in American politics.

Through the analysis of contemporary readings, historical first-hand accounts, and theoretical treatments of institutional and policy change, the course will use this period as a lens through which to

"end": {"hour": 11, "minute": 30}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Course Overview:<br/><br/>Cell biology is the study of the dynamic relationship between cellular activity and structure, on a microscopic level. It was one of the very first forms of biological inquiry. As evidenced by van Leeuwenhoek, the study of the cell is inseparable from technological innovations that permit its visualization, none more important than the microscope. Time and again in this course you will see that advancement of our understanding of the microscopic world requires innovation.<br/><br/>Given that the American Society for Cell Biology is itself over 50 years old, clearly we will not be able to cover everything that constitutes the study of the cell. Our approach is to organize the course into three broad sections: Extracellular, Cytoplasm, and Nucleus. In each of these modules there will be a focus on our current understanding of the most salient aspects of inquiry. See Schedule to review all of the topics covered. <br/><br/>Each module will be comprised of three weeks of instruction followed by an exam. Monday and Wednesday are lectures. Each Monday two papers related to the week's topic will be assigned. On Friday, three students will present the papers at hand. The students who are not presenting will be required to submit a one-page write-up of the papers. <br/><br/>TA Tutorial:<br/><br/>There are three tutorial sessions that are taught by TAs, on \"Meiosis and cell cycle\", \"Stem cell regeneration and differentiation\", and \"Cell death (apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis)\", which are important cell biology topics not specifically covered by the lectures. The tutorial materials may be incorporated in the Friday paper discussion.<br/><br/>Paper Assignment/Presentation:<br/><br/>The goal of the research paper component of the course is to be both exposed to the most current research in a given area and to have to think critically about hypothesis testing. Thus, the presentations of the papers on Friday will not be comprehensive. Rather, the presenters will provide a brief background and then delve into the hypothesis of the papers and the figure(s) that most conclusively support it. This will hopefully lead to a spirited discussion by the class of whether the authors have successfully tested their hypothesis and how their approach may be improved. It is the goal of the presenters to not merely regurgitate the data but to lead a discussion on the merits of each experiment and to address whether the main conclusions of the paper are warranted based on the data presented. Each week there will be two papers to discuss but there will be either two or three presenters (due to the class size). When there are three students, one student will be responsible for giving a brief 15-minute introduction to the topic covered by the papers. This should focus on the big picture question that the papers are dealing with and the import of this question to the field. Each of the other two presenters will be responsible for discussing the important features and conclusion of one paper. If two presenters, then each is responsible for one of the papers. Due to time constraints these presentations will not be able to include all of the data in the papers and it is the presenter's chief responsibility to identify the hypothesis being tested and the key experiments worthy of discussion. We expect this to be a class wide discussion and the presenter's goal is to lead this discussion. We anticipate that the two papers will be related in some way, either by contradicting each other, supporting each other with different approaches, etc.<br/><br/>Question Session for Presentation:<br/>Each group of (two or three) presenters will ask two separate (independent) questions per person in the paper presentation from the preceding group (that is, students who present in the 2nd week will ask questions in the 1st week presentation, etc.). You should discuss with your group mates prior to the class to make sure that the questions do not overlap. The group of students who present in the 1st week will ask questions during the presentation in the last week. The question session will be strictly monitored and graded by the TAs. Thus, the presenters should prepare for different types of questions on the papers and answer them in class, although the answering part will not be graded. <br/><br/>Write-ups for Paper Assignment:<br/>Each student not presenting must submit a write-up prior to the Friday discussion. As above, the write-up should not be a regurgitation of what is contained in the studies. Rather, a well-done evaluation will contain these components:<br/><br/>1. A clear statement of the hypotheses being tested in the papers.<br/>2. A description of the key experiments that support the hypotheses.<br/>3. An evaluation of whether the conclusions of the studies are justified by the data, and if not how might the analysis be improved.<br/><br/>Because concision is critical, a single page is all that is required. <br/> <br/>Tests:<br/><br/>As indicated above, after each of the three modules there will be an exam. These exams will be in class, scheduled for two hours. The exams will not seek to have you parrot the lectures (we're assuming you will know the material thoroughly); rather, we want to evaluate your ability to apply what you've learned toward comprehending data and designing approaches to test hypotheses."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Assessment:<br/><br/>Paper Assignment and Presentation - 25% (20% Write-ups, 3% Presentation, 2% verbal questions for the succeeding group presentation)<br/>Exams - 3 x 25% = 75%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "N/A"}]}, {"id": "27011", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "TGS", "subjectId": "IGP", "courseId": "410-0", "name": "Molecular Biology", "sectionNumber": "1", "instructors": ["Daniel Richard Foltz"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We", "Fr"], "start": {"hour": 9, "minute": 15}, "end": {"hour": 10, "minute": 15}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "27012", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "TGS", "subjectId": "IGP", "courseId": "425-0", "name": "Topics in Drug Discovery", "sectionNumber": "1", "instructors": ["Daniel Martin   Watterson"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo"], "start": {"hour": 16, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 18, "minute": 0}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}]}, {"id": "27013", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "TGS", "subjectId": "IGP", "courseId": "433-0", "name": "Advanced Microbial Pathogenesis", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Derek Francis Walsh"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 16, "minute": 0}, "location": "TBA"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This is a paper discussion and grant-writing course for those that have already taken classes in basic microbiology.

While its arrival on the scene is already impacting materials science and molecular nanotechnology, it is also providing a new lease of life to chemical synthesis where mechanical bond formation occurs as a consequence of the all-important templation orchestrated by molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. The way in which covalent bond formation activates noncovalent bonding interactions, switching on molecular recognition that leads to self-assembly and the template-directed synthesis of mechanically interlocked moleculesof which the so-called catenanes and rotaxanes may be regarded as the prototypeshas introduced a level of integration into chemical synthesis that has not previously been attained. The challenge now is to carry this level of integration beyond relatively small molecules into the realms of precisely functionalized extended molecular structures and aggregated superstructures that perform functions in a collective manner as the key sources of instruction, activation and performance in multi-component integrated devices.<br/><br/>In this course I will propose the adoption of the term mechanostereochemistry to describe the rapidly emerging area of chemical science where components of molecules and extended structures are mechanically interlocked or sterically encumbered in such a manner that the components interact dynamically with one another as a result of a panoply of weak noncovalent bonds and/or as a consequence of dynamic coordinative or covalent bonds. Mechanostereochemistry is the stereochemistry of molecules with mechanical bonds. The practice of mechanostereochemistry can be seen to have both a creative aspect (molecular recognition, self-assembly, templation, etc.) and a functional role (relative movements of components, switching, self-energizing, etc.) associated with its territory. Both the creative aspect and the functional role are dynamic in nature and ultimately molecular in context. The conundrum facing the wider chemical community at present is to unravel how to get from relatively small, yet highly programmable molecules to contraptions and gadgets that do something useful in the real world."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "None"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Meets only January 13-24"}]}, {"id": "24004", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "CHEM", "courseId": "419-0", "name": "Advanced Organic Synthesis - Concepts and Applications", "sectionNumber": "01", "instructors": ["Regan James Thomson"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We", "Fr"], "start": {"hour": 10, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 10, "minute": 50}, "location": "Technological Institute M120"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The design of synthetic routes to natural products and other medicinally relevant organic compounds will be covered in detail.

The economic approach to law assumes that punishments such as incarceration or fines are implicit prices for violating the law. According to this view, these prices may be chosen in such a way that will yield the most socially desirable outcome. Of course, it may not be appropriate to judge laws entirely based on their economic efficiency. For example, it may also be appropriate to consider outcomes that are \"fair\" or \"just,\" however defined, and these outcomes may not be the most efficient. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that efficiency is one important criterion for purposes of judging the law. Given that economists are often interested in studying incentives, it is therefore quite natural that we might be both interested and perhaps even well-equipped to analyze various areas of the law. Along these lines, we will seek to employ simple economic models in order to understand the efficiency of laws in several areas, including torts, contracts, property, and crime.

It tells the story of a country gentleman who reads too many chivalric romances, and fancies himself a knight on a quest for glory. The novel poses some of the most profound questions about the value and importance of literature. Why do we read and love literature, and how does that love manifest itself? How is our view of the world shaped by the fictions we read? Where is the line between fiction and reality? What are the dangers of too much reading? Don't we need fictions to transfigure the world into the beautiful and noble place we want it to be? Don Quixote - this complex novel, which seems to contain everything in itself - is also a reflection on a rapidly modernizing world. As intimate feudal societies vanish into a mere memory, how are individuals left alienated and feeling like they don't belong? How can the world be made more humane, welcoming, hospitable as a commercial modernity wreaks havoc on the social bonds between people?<br/><br/>Don Quixote provides the model for innumerable eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novels, many of them by and about women, and concerned with women's alienation from a patriarchal culture at odds with the stories they read. After reading selections from Don Quixote, we will read a range of quixotic novels including Charlotte Lennox's Female Quixote, Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey and Emma, and Flaubert's Madame Bovary, to understand how they use the new form of the novel to critique and transfigure the cultures they are confronted with: modernity, patriarchy, enlightenment, print culture, market society, scientific realism and much else. Above all, we will ask why storytelling remains indispensable even in a disenchanted modern world.<br/><br/>This class is an introduction to the practice of literary criticism. For each class, we will read short works of criticism alongside the novels, and seek to apply their methods to the analysis of the novels. We will explore a wide range of methods, such as surface reading, distant reading, theory of the novel, genre analysis, cognitive approaches, Marxism, feminism, structuralism, new formalism, and more, to ask what we can learn by studying literature through these lenses. We will find that the novels themselves are highly reflective about novel writing, offering their own theories about the form of the novel, its relation to society, the virtues of realism, and finally, the dangers and possibilities of fiction. Ultimately, this will be a class about how our love of stories both deludes us and gives us hope for a better world."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Notes: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

The aim in 307 is to discern and employ writing techniques that overarch these various genres, to study the subject through doing-by writing your own fabulist stories. We will read examples of fabulism as writers read: to understand how these fictions are made-studying them from the inside out, so to speak. Many of these genres overlap. For instance, they are all rooted in the tale, a kind of story that goes back to primitive sources. They all speculate: they ask the question What If? They all are stories that demand invention, which, along with the word transformation, will be the key terms in the course. The invention might be a monster, a method of time travel, an alien world, etc., but with rare exception the story will demand an invention and that invention will often also be the central image of the story. So, in discussing how these stories work we will also be learning some of the most basic, primitive moves in storytelling. To get you going I will be bringing in exercises that employ fabulist techniques and hopefully will promote stories. These time tested techniques will be your entrances-your rabbit holes and magic doorways-into the figurative.

Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, \"wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth.\" Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term \"cin\u00e9criture,\" or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script.

At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses.

Each episode was sponsored by a particular craft guild, and the allocation of these episodes created complicated, and sometimes deliberately comic, relationships between the audience, the actors, and the roles they played. The shipwrights, perhaps predictably, use the York Building of the Ark pageant to advertise their wares. But in the York Crucifixion, the carpenters represent themselves as incompetent woodworkers who compound Jesus's suffering by being comically bad at their job of building a cross and nailing Jesus to it. When Jesus finally speaks from the cross to say \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" he thus refers to their craftsmanship as well as their sin. In the nearby town of Chester, the cloth-makers were responsible not only for the spectacular costume of the Serpent, with a woman's face, feathered body, and snake's tale, but also for the clothes Adam and Eve put on after the Fall, marking their loss of innocence. In this course we will read a selection of pageants from the York, Chester, and Wakefield Corpus Christi cycles before considering morality plays such as Mankind and Everyman and topical plays such as the Croxton Play of the Sacrament. Where the cycle plays were civic celebrations using amateur actors, the morality and topical plays seem to have toured as money-making ventures.

One play from the same time asks rhetorically, \"Had not ye rather, for novelty's sake, see Jerusalem ye never saw, than London that ye see hourly?\" At the same time, though, and often in the same plays, playgoers examined the city of London and its customs with a new care.

This class will provide an in-depth look at Jane Austen's development as a writer, in the context of the \"culture wars\" in Britain in the 1790s, in the wake of the French Revolution. We will begin by reading Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France and Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in order to better understand how Austen navigates the treacherous waters of the revolution controversies, and develops her own idiosyncratic solution to these social crises. Arguments abound about whether Austen is a conservative or progressive writer, but we will find that these conventional categories are inadequate to understand her inventive approach to the social upheavals of her day.<br/><br/>We will read a range of Austen's novels, including Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park and Emma. But we will also have the opportunity to read some of Austen's precocious juvenilia, selections from her letters, a sampling of her unfinished works (Lady Susan, The Watsons, Sanditon), memoirs, and contemporary criticism. Our goal will be to understand the experimental and fluid nature of Austen's thought, as well as the way in which she transformed the history of the novel.<br/><br/>Throughout, we will focus especially on the problem of \"judgment\" as it plays out in enlightenment and counter-enlightenment thought. Enlightenment progressives condemn pre-judice and want everyone to judge for themselves, but conservatives understand the importance of custom, tradition and experience for developing judgment. Austen is one of the few in the period to have grasped the full scope of the problem. Working against the seductions of eighteenth-century sentimentality and the romance plot which threaten a reader's capacity for judgment, Austen designs narratives that compel her readers to engage in a sophisticated practice of judgment and evaluation. Some of Austen's most distinctive narrative strategies, such as \"free indirect discourse,\" are in the service of a pedagogy of judgment that is at the heart of her novelistic project. The supple and attentive strategies of judgment she honed in her novels are as relevant today against a reductive scientism and disoriented aestheticism as they were when Austen first penned them."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Note: This course will be significantly different from previous iterations of the course I have taught under the same title.<br/><br/>Pre 1830"}]}, {"id": "24367", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "358-0", "name": "Dickens", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Christopher   Herbert"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 15, "minute": 30}, "end": {"hour": 16, "minute": 50}, "location": "Parkes Hall 212"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course we will consider Dickens, \"arguably second only to Shakespeare in the pantheon of English writers,\" as an analyst of the troubled social, psychological, and spiritual patterns of modern life, trying to see how his innovations in novelistic technique (notably his development of veins of lunatic comedy that can only be called \"dickensian\") arise from and at the same time give form to his vividly idiosyncratic vision of modernity."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation based on class presentations and participation, quizzes, and a term paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "David Copperfield (1849-50); Bleak House (1852-53); and Little Dorrit (1855-57)."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "The instructor disclaims responsibility for any cases of addiction to reading Victorian fiction traceable to this course.<br/><br/>Post 1830"}]}, {"id": "24368", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "ENGLISH", "courseId": "366-0", "name": "Studies in African American Literature", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Justin L Mann"], "topic": "Black Feminist World-making", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We"], "start": {"hour": 15, "minute": 30}, "end": {"hour": 16, "minute": 50}, "location": "555 Clark B03"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Black Feminist World-Making examines the long and rich tradition of world-making in black feminist fiction and non-fiction.

Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

The analogy holds for writing; one learns to write by doing: writing and rewriting. It is the craft of each art that can be learned, and it is craft that the artist relies on to make and improve a piece. And so the writing workshop is craft oriented. Because the medium, language, is an abstraction, the tools of writing stories-which are central to human thought-are not pens or typewriters or computers, but abstractions: scenic construction, dialogue, etc. That's what governs improving one's in-process work and that is what we come together to discuss in each class. The stories that people in the class are working on will organically lead to discussions about the craft of writing that will apply not just to that particular story, but to the art of writing in general-to all our stories.

Electrical interference?noise?turned out to be the cause. Alexander Graham Bell found that when he bound two copper lines loosely together, the twisted pair greatly improved the ratio of signal-to-noise. That discovery led to the balanced circuits in place today, connecting billions of people to zettabytes of imbalanced data. Our nonfiction workshop takes inspiration from the twisted pair by reading essays that coil loosely and at times haphazardly around one another, as when Ginger Strand channels and ultimately furthers John Berger's \"Why Look at Animals?\" (1977) with her essay \"Why Look at Fish?\" in 2005. When Teju Cole rereads and reconsiders James Baldwin's \"Stranger in the Village\" (1953) with his own written attempt in 2014, a reader can't help but feel as though one is eavesdropping on a master class. Another essay pair finds resonance in the use of extended metaphor, as in \"The Last Vet\" (2010) by Aminatta Forna and \"Driving as Metaphor\" (2019) by Rachel Cusk. Both \"Stop Blaming Jaws\" (2013) by Heather Havrilesky and \"F/X Porn\" (1998) by David Foster Wallace find congruence in the cinema as subject matter, each drilling down to one blockbuster in particular, one attacking as the other defends.

This being a workshop, we will take inspiration from these readings and filter them through our own biases and blind-spots, producing new written work intended for audiences of the literary essay.

We then turn to the pre-history of this moment to explore the very different terms, demands and imaginaries that shaped the reproductive politics of the late 1960s and 1970s by investigating several new-left identified projects - including feminist \"self-help\" clinics, community \"survival\" programs, and the establishment of a network of community health centers as a praxis of \"direct democracy\"?that critique the norms and policies governing the reproduction of individuals and communities for their contribution to the social reproduction of a patriarchal and white-supremacist capitalist social order and attempted to build counter-cultural institutions that prefigured a more equitable social order committed to \"reproductive freedom\" for all. In the final unit, we investigate how the analysis and demands of a resurgent \"reproductive justice movement\" led by women of color reimagines reproduction in terms of systems and structures that produce the inequitable distribution of life chances and expands the terrain of reproductive politics to include demands for racial, economic and environmental justice as prerequisites for exercising the right to have or not have children and to parent the children we do have."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Each unit includes a research component (& short research assignment) and students will work in groups to produce a final research project, which will be incorporated into a spring-quarter exhibition in the main library."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All course materials will be available on Canvas."}]}, {"id": "24452", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "GNDR_ST", "courseId": "340-0", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and the Law", "sectionNumber": "20", "instructors": ["Stefan   Vogler"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Tu", "Th"], "start": {"hour": 15, "minute": 30}, "end": {"hour": 16, "minute": 50}, "location": "Parkes Hall 224"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This class offers an introduction to the relationship between gender, sexuality, and law in the United States, both historically and currently.

The point of this orientation is to create a fluid, creative, and comparative interplay across feminist texts and theorists that is activated by a collective spirit of interrogation and problematizing, while at the same time resisting the presentist, progress narrative attitude that holds whatever comes later is always better and what is past is irrevocably dead (one of the potential drawbacks of \"wave\" thinking).

In addition to reading Rushdie's Midnight's Children, we will spend time with a variety of literary and artistic works, including fiction, memoir, poetry, and film. Secondary works by scholars of literature and history will help us get below the surface and to consider a variety of ways to think about democracy, conflict, artistic modernism, and the postcolonial condition, among other themes. At the same time as we consider the form and content of the texts, we will also seek to understand the dilemmas and insights that emerge from reading and writing translations. Two overlapping courses are offered: ASIAN_LC 260-0 is open to anyone and will be taught entirely in English, while HIND_URD 316 is open to students with suitable proficiency in Hindi or Urdu.

Dilemmas rooted in histories of imperialism haunt South Asian nation-states and South Asian communities living in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world today. In this course, we will examine a range of themes and issues related to this diverse region and its complex histories. How did the British state consolidate political control in this region? How did colonial authority transform during these centuries? How did British Indians challenge the many edifices of imperialism and wrest political independence in 1947? What is the place of imperialism in the creation and evolution of diasporic South Asian communities? In addition, we will reflect on socio-political movements that sought to redress gender and caste inequality and investigate their fraught relationship with the colonial state, anti-colonial nationalism, and the ongoing project of post-colonial nation-making.

Recently, numerous scholars have argued that, since the advent of modernity, mass violence has become more murderous, especially during the last century. Its persistence and intensification has triggered a lot of scholarly debates about its origins and nature, particularly how it functions and why so many people got implicated in the violence.

For the first, the course will survey the development of the major schools jurisprudence in the eighth and ninth century, their establishment throughout Africa, Asia, and Southern Europe through the classical period, modern transformations of the Shar??a since the 18th century, and contemporary developments in which diverse actors around the globe contest the meanings and relationships of the Shar??a, liberal democracy, and the modern state.

sixteenth century to its demise amid the cataclysm of the First World War. Today, the territory that the Habsburgs once ruled in Central Europe encompasses all or part of a dozen European countries from Italy in the West to Romania in the East, Poland to the north, and Bosnia to the south. At the empire's greatest expanse, its peoples spoke more than a dozen major languages and belonged to various branches of Christianity, Judaism and Islam. With an eye to this great diversity, we will read different historiographical approaches to the cultural, economic, political, social and intellectual history of the empire and its successor states. We will end with the interwar Habsburg legacy and its destruction during the years of Nazi conquest."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate Students Only"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will gain extensive knowledge of the history of the Habsburg Monarchy and familiarity with its historical literature."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion, presentations, weekly response papers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All books will also be available on reserve - no need to order any.<br/><br/>Dubin, Lois C.

Insecurity and daunting scarcity of physical and legal resources are ever more parts and parcels of displaced communities' lives. Health disparities and death rates are particularly high among these communities and have long-term social and psychological effects on the lives of the survivors. This course focuses on health disparities and differentiated mortality rates in order to tackles issues of (il)legality, citizenship, and integration among contemporary displaced communities around the world. It proposes to investigate people's lives and deaths in times of displacement and indeterminacy to ask: What legal and political constraints reinforce health disparities and social inequalities among displaced communities? To what extent refugees' appeal for rights to citizenship and to health can go beyond the conventional forms of sovereign state power? What are the benefits and limits of (non)governmental organizations' services for displaced communities? Knowledge of these efforts calls attention to the achievements and shortcomings of humanitarianism, the lesser-recognized ways that displaced communities heal and survive political and environmental instabilities, and the possible approaches that governmental authorities and the international community could implement in their agenda for the global displacement crisis. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary and research-intensive course uses ethnographic studies to model successful qualitative research designs for students. Further, by familiarizing them with the main theoretical approaches in ethnographic research, it helps them develop a critical lens towards the current national and transnational regimes of care in relation to displaced people. It has large implications for students who are interested in global health, physical and mental health disparities among migrant communities, international legal frameworks, human rights and humanitarianism, and national laws and citizenship status. Key topics of the course will include: national and international policies to the current displacement crisis, humanitarian interventions, legality and transnationalism, the global economy of care, and human rights in theory and practice."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of this course, students will be equipped with:<br/>?

Yet, as this course will emphasize, the history and historiography of modern Israel go far beyond the \"ripped from the headlines and history books\" accounts of decades of clashes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - we will examine the complex internal dynamics of each society-in-progress as well as the external processes that shaped both of their polities and their quest for peace.<br/> The syllabus has been organized in 8 week units as departures on the theme of \"aliya\" (lit. ascendance), a Zionist concept that has attached a positive and religiously-infused valance to Jewish national project and wave of immigrant-absorption prior to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. I have adapted this framework not only to cover both the pre- and post-state period in Israel/Palestine but also to put into focus many groups that were marginalized from this classic history of modern Israel. We will examine both continuity and change since 1948 when it came to the creation of the \"new Jew,\" successive waves of Jewish migration, Zionist settlement, and the \"Arab\" (or Palestinian) question. The goal of the course is gain a deeper appreciation of not only of the wars on the battlefield and between world leaders over the past century, but the major political, social, cultural, and religious trends that have profoundly shaped two societies in conflict - and perhaps one day, conciliation.<br/> The course will draw not only from scholarly texts but memoir, literature, photography, film, music, and other forms of digital history to gain a multi-faceted view of the modern Israel.

This course introduces the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic forces on the one hand, and legal rules, practices, and outcomes, on the other. We focus on several important questions about law including: How do culture, structure, and conflict explain the relationship between law and society? Why do people obey the law? Why do people go to court? How does the legal system work? What is the role of lawyers, judges, and juries? How does law on the books differ from law in action?

This course will explore the origins of the concept in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law's form and political consequences. The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Max Weber, Walter Benjamin, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Jeremy Waldron, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. Your grade will be based on assessments of one-page weekly papers analyzing a citation of your choice from the assigned texts; a class presentation; participation; and a final paper. This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation - does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?<br/><br/>POLI_SCI 309-0 and LEGAL_ST 309-0 are taught together; may not receive credit for both courses."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Aeschylus.

It is intuitive that if you shuffle your deck sufficiently many times, the deck will be in an approximately random order. But how many shuffles are sufficient?<br/><br/>A shuffle is a permutation of the n cards, so we can model card shuffling as a random walk on the group S_n of permutations of n objects. It is an example of a Markov chain, a type of stochastic process that \"forgets its past\" as it evolves in time. Markov chain models are widely used in many areas such as statistical mechanics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, to name a few. Of great interest are questions about mixing times, that is the length of time the Markov chain has to run to be sufficiently close to its stationary distribution. Frequently, the number of elements in the state space is large, and asymptotic results about rates of convergence, as the size of the state space increases, are relevant. The seminar will examine mixing times for Markov chains as a function of the size and geometry of the state space and will include many examples. Key methods include eigenvalue techniques, coupling techniques, and strong stationary times.<br/><br/>For \"riffle shuffles\", 8 shuffles will sufficiently mix the deck. Moreover, the seminar will cover the \"cut-off phenomenon\": For some Markov chains, convergence to stationarity does not happen gradually over time but rather sharply (akin to a phase transition) around a point in time that depends on the size of the group. For riffle-shuffling a deck of n cards, the cut-off occurs at around 3/2 log_2(n) steps.<br/><br/>Prerequisites: A background in undergraduate Probability and in Markov chain theory (such as 311-1, 2 or 310-1, 2), basic Linear Algebra."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook listed/required"}]}, {"id": "22134", "termId": "4770", "schoolId": "WCAS", "subjectId": "MATH", "courseId": "410-2", "name": "Analysis", "sectionNumber": "71", "instructors": ["Antonio C Auffinger"], "topic": "", "schedules": [{"dow": ["Mo", "We", "Fr"], "start": {"hour": 13, "minute": 0}, "end": {"hour": 13, "minute": 50}, "location": "Lunt Hall 101"}], "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "First and Second Quarters: Real analysis.

According to Kant, it evades the choice between saying that we must have an conceptualized access to reality in order to have factual knowledge (so that it is hard to say how we as concept-using knowers can know reality at all) on the one hand, and saying that the reality our factual knowledge represents is determined by our concepts (so that it is hard to say in what way reality is a mind-independent constraint on belief). Kant suggests that this is a non-issue if there is only one universal set of concepts constitutive of all (genuinely fact-enabling) human experience. But the course of scientific progress since reveals this as a big (and unfulfilled) IF: in light of the diversity of experience and of the sciences, it is not easy to insist that there is only one set of forms of all possible objects of experience, one set of categories to form judgments, one set of principles to form natural laws.

This course will explore the origins of the concept in European political thought and compare selected theorists' descriptions of the relation between law's form and political consequences.<br/><br/>The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university. The jurisprudence of U.S. statutory interpretation will be explored through analysis of debates about the implementation of national security and sexual harassment policies. The theoretical frameworks of Max Weber, Walter Benjamin, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, Jacques Derrida, Catherine MacKinnon, Jeremy Waldron, and Janet Halley will be compared for their usefulness in understanding the interpretation of contemporary laws and imagining alternatives. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. Your grade will be based on assessments of one-page weekly papers analyzing a citation of your choice from the assigned texts; a class presentation; participation; and a final paper.<br/><br/>This class introduces students to the primary texts, theories, and techniques necessary for grasping the rule of law in the United States today. The objective is to improve basic legal literacy in the context of larger questions of political and legal theory. Skills student learn include legal research using online databases, including LexisUni, and Proquest Congressional research databases, as well as how to understand the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations. Students learn these skills in the context of reflecting on larger principles of statutory interpretation - does a law mean what the plain text says, what Congress \"intends,\" or a \"purpose\" imputed to law by judges?"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Attendance at first class required"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Aeschylus.

The goal is to understand how the forces of capitalism shape politics and law, and how politics and law enable capitalism. <br/><br/>The law part of this equation may not be readily apparent. Capitalism is by design a form of creative destruction. Market forces and the pursuit of profit are supposed to spur innovation and economic development that benefits all. Because capitalism operates through creative destruction, the market, trade and monetary dimensions of capitalism have always been regulated. Indeed a fundamental premise of this course is that there is no such thing as a free market; markets are always regulated. The way governments regulate markets is through law, and thus law enables capitalism in essential ways. For example, property is protected by law, which defines what counts as property (e.g. intellectual property law turns an idea into property, financial law creates balance sheet assets), and through a distribution of rights wherein property owners gain an enforceable legal right to have their property protected. In the era of globalization, law has facilitated the flow of financial capital in ways that greatly constrain governments and contribute to huge wealth inequities.<br/><br/>The historical part of the equation helps us better understand the political choices across time, and thus better understand how politics, technology, and culture shape the choices we make. By examining capitalism across time, we can better understand the interaction of choice and structural forces generated by capitalism (e.g. the industrial revolution, the creation of global supply chains, and the unleashing of global finance), and the changing political calculus as empire declined and democracy evolved. <br/><br/>The normative part of the equation will always be in the room. Our political decisions regarding how we use law to protect property and to facilitate capitalism has huge costs and consequences.

Globalization means greater interdependence and less national autonomy. It occurs as international flows of capital, goods, services, and people increase. Transactions, interactions and relationships that formerly occurred within national boundaries now occur across them. But transactions and relationships involving capital, goods, services and people are not self-sustaining. Rather, they are supported and regulated by an institutional foundation that typically centers on the legal system. As part of globalization, particular legal and institutional forms are also spreading throughout the world. Because the legal and institutional frameworks that support these transactions exist primarily at the level of the nation-state, a governance mismatch has emerged. Globalization means that more is going on between national jurisdictions than within them, and tensions arise between competing institutional models. Thus, globalization motivates both an extension of legal systems, and a confrontation between different legal systems that can be resolved conflictually or concordantly. Either outcome leads to institutional convergence. We consider a number of different kinds of law but focus especially on commercial law, quasi-legal trade agreements (e.g., WTO), and commercially-relevant quasi-legal institutions. We pay attention to legal developments in developing and transitional economies, and also consider how the international community deals with significant common problems like economic inequality and global climate change."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prior social science courses are desirable but not required."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will acquire a more sophisticated understanding of globalization as both a condition and a process, and will appreciate the role that law and legal institutions play in globalization."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture/discussion in a seminar-like setting."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be expected to participate in discussion, to lead discussion, and to write a 12 page (or so) final paper on a topic of their choosing (subject to instructor approval)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "\"Dani Rodrik.
